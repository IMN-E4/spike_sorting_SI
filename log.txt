    July 2021: we created the following scripts- 
        compute_peaks.py, compute_tridesclous_several_times.py, spike_sorting_pipeline,
        test_ephyviewer_spike.py, test_ephyviewer.py

        Remarks: 
        1. We identified that TDC and SpykingCircus were not providing the same results after different sorting runs.
        2. Even though we built the pipeline for drift checking, corrections are not available yet.
        3. Most features are already available in EPHYVIEWER, but we still need to add spectrograms.
