Creating a file so that we keep track of the things we are doing:

    July 2021: we created the following scripts- 
        compute_peaks.py, compute_tridesclous_several_times.py, spike_sorting_pipeline,
        test_ephyviewer_spike.py, test_ephyviewer.py

        Remarks: 
        1. We identified that TDC and SpykingCircus were not providing the same results after different sorting runs.
        2. Even though we built the pipeline for drift checking, corrections are not available yet.
        3. Most features are already available in EPHYVIEWER, but we still need to add spectrograms.

    September 2021:
        - We updated SI to incorporate Samuel's updates. We also installed SI-GUI (not working yet), and spike sorting through docker images.
        - Eduarda updated the spike_sorting_pipeline to incorporate the new changes and tested it.

        Remarks:
        1. SI-GUI not working yet, kills the PC because it goes out of memory.
        2. SpykingCircus worked using docker image, TDC took much longer and gave an error while trying to clean files, YASS was too much for our GPU. (folders in /home/arthur/)
        3. For some reason, when using the docker images, the output_path doesn't work (it complains about the folder not existing yet). This does not occur when running the local sorters.
        4. Eduarda ran again SS and TDC locally to create new output, they can be found at /media/storage/spikesorting_output/sorting_pipeline_out_29092021_try/rest/filter/
        5. TDC found 12 units, and I was able to get the whole report folder. SS found 396 units, but I could not get the report folder completly (runs out of memory).
